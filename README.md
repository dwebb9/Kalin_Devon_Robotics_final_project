For this project we will be simulating robotic arms and implementing two different obstacle avoidance and/or path planning algorithms based on the following two papers:

- [Path Planning of 6-DOF Venipuncture Robot Arm Based on Improved A-star and Collision Detection Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8961668)
- [Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance for Manipulators and Mobile Robotics](https://cs.stanford.edu/group/manips/publications/pdfs/Khatib_1986_IJRR.pdf)
